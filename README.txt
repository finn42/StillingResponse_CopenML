Stilling Response analysis on the published motion recordings collected from the audience of the Copenhagen MusicLab Experiment Concert, published in the Musiclab Copenhagen OSF repository https://osf.io/ac6yt/

These analyses combine information about the music performed (from audio recordings and scores) with the measurements of audience body motion recorded on participants chests using either their own mobile phone with the MusicLab app or the AX3 sensors. Analysis only considered the participants who attended this chamber music concert face to face. The program included string quartets by Beethoven and Schnittke as well as an excerpt of JS Bach and arrangements of Nordic folk music. 

The music performance was studied for moments of "stilling": when features of the performance shifted towards quiet and less movement. 257 moments were identified through the study of the music, and compared to the concurrent the quantity of motion of audience members. Files describing these selected moments can be found in the data files of this repository, with timestamps corresponding to a video of the concert currently available on Youtube: https://youtu.be/S4UVJybA6ZQ
